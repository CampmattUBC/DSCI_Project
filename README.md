# DSCI_Project
our group project 
This is the repository for the DSCI 100 group project that I've been working on.
I have looked into various datasets and found that the heart data seems to be the best for answering questions.
I have started downloading/manipulating the data and been thinking about possible questions for our proposal.

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/processed.switzerland.data This is the link to the specific data I am using.

I have added most of the base elements for the project.

Here is a to do list: Feb 27th
The coding section must be re-done so that it complies to the project proposal rules.
We must add a few more references.
The main writing must be edited.
We must play with the data to decide what variable we should actually use to answer our question.
We must not use any local files for our dada reading. Everything must be pulled directly from the web.
